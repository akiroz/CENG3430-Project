BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer btn_lf_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer btn_rt_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning

Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP nolabel_line28/ccnt1/U0/i_synth/i_baseip.i_xbip_counter/i_dsp48.i_dsp/i_vx7.i_dsp48e_wrap/i_primitive input nolabel_line28/ccnt1/U0/i_synth/i_baseip.i_xbip_counter/i_dsp48.i_dsp/i_vx7.i_dsp48e_wrap/i_primitive/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line28/clr_count_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line28/clr_count_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell nolabel_line28/clr_count_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line28/nclk_100M is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line28/bg1_i_1/O, cell nolabel_line28/bg1_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	btn_dn_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to R16
	btn_dn_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y2

The RAMB18E1 nolabel_line28/vdrv1/vram1/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.SIMPLE_PRIM18.ram has an input control pin nolabel_line28/vdrv1/vram1/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.SIMPLE_PRIM18.ram/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (net: nolabel_line28/vdrv1/vram1/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/addrb[2]) which is driven by a register (nolabel_line28/vdrv1/px_h_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
